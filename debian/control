Description: Node.js 0.12 path.isAbsolute() ponyfill
 Path-is-absolute is a Node.js module that gives developers the ability to
 determine whether a path written in programming language is an absolute path.
 An absolute path will always resolve to the same location, regardless of the
 working directory. Path-is-absolute is a ponyfill, meaning that it does not
 overwrite the native method in a JavaScript environment.
